# Indian Railways Delay Data Analysis
#  Dataset

Source: Train Delay Dataset (IRCTC, Kaggle)

This dataset contains information about train schedules, actual arrival times, delays, and related parameters from Indian Railways.

#  Project Overview

Train delays are a common issue faced by millions of passengers in India.
This project aims to analyze why and when trains delay the most, uncovering key insights and building a simple predictive model.

#  Objectives

Identify patterns and trends in train delays.

Analyze factors influencing delay duration (e.g., route, time, season).

Build a simple linear regression model to predict possible delays.

#  Concepts Used

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization

Simple Linear Regression (Bonus: Delay Prediction Model)

#  Tools & Technologies

Google Colab – for analysis and visualization

Python Libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for regression modeling

#  Key Insights

Certain routes and times of day show higher delay frequencies.

Delays increase during monsoon and winter seasons.

Arrival time and route type are significant predictors of delay duration.

#  Model Overview

Model Used: Simple Linear Regression
Goal: Predict train delay time based on selected features.
Result: The model provides an approximate delay estimation with moderate accuracy (for demonstration purposes).
